# JavaScript - DOM - Tic Tac Toe

## Description

I wanted to do something fun and challenging but at the same time not too difficult.
After seeing someone make the Snake game and someone else the Pong game I felt there was only Tic Tac Toe left.

It has a few features I will now list here:
- animated loading screen using CSS and setTimeout
- the ability to restart the game, sore loosers will appreciate
- there is also a clock on the screen because it is a requirement in 
the project description, it has nothing to do with the game but I hads to do what I hads to do

It is styled using CSS and I am a tiny bit proud, it turned out better than I expected.
