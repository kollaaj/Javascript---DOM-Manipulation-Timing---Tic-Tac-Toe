## javascript - Dom - Tic Tac Toe

## Description

I wanted to do something fun and challenging but at the same time not to difficult.
After seeing someone make a snake game and another pong I felt there was only toc tac toe left.
It has a few features I will now list here:
- animated loading screen using css and setTimeout
- the ability to restart the game, sore loosers will appreciate
- there is also a clock on the screen because it is a minimum requirement in 
the project description, It has nothing to do with the game but I hads to do what I hads to do.
It is styled using css, I am a tiny bit proud, it turned out better than I expected
